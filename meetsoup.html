    <h2>Project Proposal: MeetSoup</h2>
    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>Within our society there exists an emerging issue with regard to efficient food usage [1]. There also appears to be two easily distinguishable sides to this problem that we intent to address within our project. </p>
    <p> On one hand, we know that many people throw away food that is still acceptable to be consumed by humans. They may do this for the following reasons:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The person is leaving their normal premises for an extended period and cannot bring the food with them.</li>
      <li>The food is nearing the expiration date, and the person does not envision utilizing the food within that time.</li>
      <li>The food may be of substandard quality for the original consumer such as a bruised fruit or fatty meat.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>On the other hand, there are also many people who could benefit from easy access to free food. Some examples include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Many households already struggle to afford sufficient amounts of food.</li>
      <li>The person does not need the food item in bulk and prefers a smaller quantity.</li>
      <li>Some people are thrifty and simply wish to save money.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A feasible way to connect these two types of people and to redirect otherwise wasted food to the people who need it does not currently exist.</p>
